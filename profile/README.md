CoinTrend is a lightweight, free and open-source cryptocurrencies market tracker designed for Android ðŸ“±ðŸ“ˆ using Material Design 3 ðŸ’Ž and Jetpack Compose ðŸš€.


## Features

- **Market**: real-time updates of the Trending Coins (the most searched coins in the last 24h) and the Top Coins (the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap).
- **Favourites**: track your favourite coins at a glance by adding them to the favourite list.
- **Search**: search over 10.000 coins by name or symbol.

### Lightweight
CoinTrend stores coins' data locally and updates them automatically only when needed, thus minimising network data consumption and battery consumption. You can still manually trigger a data update whenever you need it by simply swiping down on each screen!

### 100% free and open-source
Don't trust, verify! CoinTrend is 100% free and does not include any ads nor trackers. Check the code out yourself and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any suggestions!

### Designed for Android
The User Interface has been designed by following the latest Google's Material Design guidelines and by using only native Android components and animations.

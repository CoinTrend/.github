### Lightweight
CoinTrend stores coins' data locally and updates them automatically only when needed, thus minimising network data consumption and battery consumption. You can still manually trigger a data update whenever you need it by simply swiping down on each screen!

### 100% free and open-source
Don't trust, verify! CoinTrend is 100% free and does not include any ads nor trackers. Check the code out yourself and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any suggestions!

### Designed for Android
The User Interface has been designed by following the latest Google's Material Design guidelines and by using only native Android components and animations.
